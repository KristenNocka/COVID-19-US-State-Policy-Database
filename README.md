# COVID-19 US State Policy Database


The COVID-19 US State Policy Database tracks the dates when each US state implemented new social safety net, economic, and physical distancing policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with data on existing health and social policies and information on state characteristics. This database is developed and maintained by researchers at the Boston University School of Public Health, and is updated at least biweekly.

We are working quickly to go through state government websites to make the policy database as complete and accurate as possible in a rapidly changing policy context. If you use data on a given policy, we encourage you to triangulate based on additional sources of policy data and to review the source documentation to consider the coding decisions that are right for your work. Of course, please email us if you note a discrepancy so we can improve the database for everyone.
